## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manuel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Linux and Linux-based software. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Ansible](https://github.com/w-manuel/learn_ansible).
- :white_check_mark: My last project was a backup recovery tool for [KVM based virtual machines](https://github.com/w-manuel/virtual_machine_restore).
- :clipboard: I only use my GitHub profile to archive my learning progress.
